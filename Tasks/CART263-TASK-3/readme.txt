*** CART 263 SECTION A TASK 3 ******

** README ***
Purpose: to explore and create interactive patterns, sketches using js eventListeners, timers
HTML and CSS.. It is recommended that you have gone through the WEEK 4 notes before 
attempting the task

*** HOPEFULLY HELPFUL INSTRUCTIONS ***

1/ Access the zip file /unzip

2/If you run the CART263-TASK-3.html you will see that there are "canvases" labeled 
TEAM A - H - > In class:  everyone was divided up into the teams A-H

3/ Then Each Team has their own JS file (js/team-<>.js) - 
and you ONLY need to add code to your own own team's file OR the global CSS file.

4/ Ok. Within your own file you will see code already implemented so that the buttons 
1-2-3 work ( look at output in console). You do not need to change the activateButtons_<> 
function.

5/ As an individual submission - you can choose to implement either aniA(), 
or aniB() or aniC(). Please use the TEAM I option.

6/ To run -> just reload the CART263-TASK-3.html and select your option (1/2/3) 
in the TEAM I canvas... to test

7/ I have provided my example as the team-h option (canvas TEAM H) - you are welcome 
to use/borrow the code as inspiration only... the idea is not to copy the patterns rather
 to come up with your own interpretations :)
 
 8/ We did not complete the task in class - so everyone will be submitting by 
 Friday Feb 7 and we will have a collaborative presentation first thing next class
 -- meaning everyone will add their code to one file and will demo the 
 results from one file.
 If you are doing the individual option - please ensure that you submit before class 
 (11 FEB) the moodle submission will be closed but you can contact me to tell me it is ready
  -> do not spend too much time! It is meant to be a class task - I know one 
 could spend alot of time/ effort ... and I do encourage you but do not want you all
 to spend too much time on this..

 If you have problems etc - you are welcome to contact me / via discord/via email 
 or in person :)
 
 9/ To submit -> provide your team<>.js file and any extra css in a separate file.
 - make a folder in your github repo and label as task 3 ... thank you!
